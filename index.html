    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a motivated Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate at Lovely Professional University
      with a strong inclination toward cybersecurity, ethical hacking, and secure software development.
      My academic journey and hands-on projects have helped me develop a solid understanding of system
      security, networking fundamentals, and programming principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      I actively engage in practical learning through cybersecurity labs, coding platforms, and
      independent projects to understand how modern systems are attacked, defended, and optimized.
      I aim to grow as a responsible security professional while contributing to secure and reliable
      technology solutions.

      <h3>Password Strength Checker</h3>
      <p class="tech">Technologies: JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p>
      <p>
        Developed a password strength analysis tool focused on improving user awareness of secure
        password practices. The application evaluates passwords based on length, character diversity,
        and known attack patterns such as dictionary-based vulnerabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project strengthened my understanding of authentication security concepts and helped me
        design user-friendly solutions for real-world security problems.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Simple Port Scanner</h3>
      <p class="tech">Technologies: Python, Ruby, R, PHP</p>
      <p>
        Designed and implemented a socket-based port scanner to identify open and closed ports on
        a target system. The project introduced me to TCP/UDP communication, multithreading,
        and network reconnaissance techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this project, I gained practical insight into ethical hacking methodologies
        and network auditing fundamentals.
      </p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>Keylogger (Educational Purpose)</h3>
      <p class="tech">Technologies: Python, JavaScript</p>
      <p>
        Built a basic keylogging application to study system-level input capture and logging
        mechanisms. Implemented secure local storage and encryption to protect collected data.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project enhanced my understanding of malware behavior while reinforcing the importance
        of defensive security practices and ethical responsibility.
